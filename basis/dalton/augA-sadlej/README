AJM: 28 April 2016
Sadlej-pVTZ basis sets augmented as follows:

    * Start from the aug-Salej basis
    * remove any diffuse functions with exponents < 0.03 a.u.
    * Do one of the following:
       * If possible, augment the outer shell with one diffuse exponent
         alpha = alpha_min/3.0
         If alpha < 0.03 a.u., discard this exponent.
       * Include one shell with l = lmax+1 and the first exponent < 1.0 a.u taken from the
         previous shell. If there is no exponent < 1.0 a.u., choose one closest to 1.0 a.u.
