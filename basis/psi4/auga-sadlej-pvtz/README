augA-Sadlej (v2) 

AJM: 28 April 2016
Sadlej-pVTZ basis sets augmented as follows:

    * Start from the aug-Salej basis
    * remove any diffuse functions with exponents < 0.03 a.u. unless they were
      already present in the original Sadlej basis set.
    * Do one of the following:
       * If possible, augment the outer shell with one diffuse exponent
         alpha = alpha_min/3.0
         If alpha < 0.03 a.u., discard this exponent.
       * Include one shell with l = lmax+1 and the first exponent < 0.5 a.u taken from the
         previous shell. If there is no exponent < 0.5 a.u., choose one closest to 0.5 a.u.

   NOTES:
     * The Sadlej basis set definition in NWChem is slighty different from those
     use in other codes. The main difference is with the number of sig figs in the
     exponents. This is 4 in NWChem and 5 to 6 in the other codes.
