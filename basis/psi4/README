These basis sets are for use by the Psi4 program. They will be used in
preference to the standard Psi4 basis library if the environment
variable PSIPATH is set to point to this directory.

Note that any comments (prefixed by "!") may occur only at the start
of the file or between a terminating "****" of one basis set and the
element-name line of the next.
