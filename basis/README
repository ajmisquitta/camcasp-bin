The file names used here need to be consistent with the atom names
used in src/atoms.f90


Basis sets from:

https://bse.pnl.gov/bse/portal

Instructions:
-------------
* Wherever possible use the Optimized General Contractions.
* ORDER basis functions from larger to smaller exponents.
  This is needed as some codes (DALTON) re-order basis functions
  to have this order. This can then cause basis inconsistencies
  as CamCASP would not know the new order. 
* DALTON basis set downloaded from the portal will not be in the
  correct format. Use the code utilities/emsl2dalton/emsl2dalton
  to write them out in the correct format.
  *** This code does not ORDER the basis functions ***
