Sadlej-pVTZ basis sets augmented as follows:

    * Start from the augA-Salej basis
    * Replace most diffuse l_max function with one even more diffuse. 
      Use next most diffuse exponent from l_max-1 set.
      ** If most diffuse l_max function was obtained from the l_max set
         by dividing by 3.0, then:
         *** Try to add another function by dividing most diffuse l_max exponent
             by 3.0. If result is < 0.03 a.u., discard.

H : [3S,2P,1d]
C : [5S,3P,2D,1f]
N : [5S,3P,2D,1f]
O : [6S,3P,2D,1f]
F : [6s,3p,2d,1f]
S : [7s,5p,2d,1f] 
Br: [10s,8p,5d,3f]
I : [11s,9p,6d,3f]

   NOTES:
     * The Sadlej basis set definition in NWChem is slighty different from those
     use in other codes. The main difference is with the number of sig figs in the
     exponents. This is 4 in NWChem and 5 to 6 in the other codes.
