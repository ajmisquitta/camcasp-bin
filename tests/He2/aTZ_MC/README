This calculation can be carried out in this directory with the command

$ runcamcasp.py He2 --clt He2.clt --directory test -q bg

(Don't type the $ here -- it's the Linux command prompt, and is shown
to distinguish Linux commands from other text.)
This will create a new subdirectory called "test" and run the
calculation there in the background "bg". An alternative is "-q batch"
which sends the job to the Linux batch queue -- useful for big jobs
but not needed here.

When the job has run we want to extract the energy components from the
CamCASP output file. The command knows where to find it in the job
directory:

$ extract_saptdft.py --unit kelvin test

kelvin      elst        exch         ind        exind       disp       exdisp       total
test     -1.43903     8.45121    -0.00348     0.00724   -18.50000     0.11106   -11.37301

The extract_saptdft.py script outputs energies in kJ/mol by default,
but the more conventional unit for the helium dimer energy is kelvin,
which is specified with the "--unit kelvin" flag. The total energy to
second order here is -11.373 K.

The subdirectory check in this directory contains the results of our
calculation for this system. To check that you have got the same
results, just use

$ extract_saptdft.py --unit kelvin test check
