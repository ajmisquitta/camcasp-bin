The scripts in this directory run some standard tests of the CamCASP
program. Success or failure depends on agreement with previous results
in check directories. They are normally run via the run_tests.py
script, using the command

run_tests.py [test test ...] [--scfcode scfcode scfcode ...] [options] [&]

If no test is specified, all tests are run in turn. The SCF code may
be dalton, nwchem or psi4. If the --scfcode option is omitted, all
installed SCF codes are used in turn. The calculations are run in the
background if "&" is specified. The results for the first five tests
below are automatically checked against previous calculations and
reported in a test_report file. There may be small differences from
the check results, owing to differences between systems.

When all tests have been completed, run
  run.tests.py [test ...] [--scfcode ...] --clean
to tidy up. This doesn't remove the test_report files but renames them
as previous_test_report. Some of the tests produce a lot of big output
files, especially the H2Oprops and H2O_dimer_scan tests, so it is
important to clean up.



Currently the tests are:

He2
  Run calculations on the helium dimer using the four basis set types
  MC, MC+, DC and DC+. Only the dalton program is used here.

H2O_dimer
  Run sapt-dft and delta-hf calculations on the water dimer in its
  equilibrium geometry.

H2O_dimer_psi4
  Run sapt-dft and delta-hf calculations on the water dimer in its
  equilibrium geometry, using the sapt(dft) code in Psi4 itself,
  rather than CamCASP. Currently this is under development and (at
  version 1.3.2) does not give correct results.

CO2-isa
  Run an ISA-dma calculation on the CO2 molecule, using the specified
  SCF code, and check the resulting ISA multipole moments.

H2Oprops
  Run an ISA-pol calculation on the water molecule, using the
  specified SCF code, localize the polarizabilities and compute and
  check the dispersion coefficients. This test depends on the Orient
  program to carry out the localization.

formamide-isa
  Run an ISA-dma calculation on the formamide molecule, and check the
  resulting ISA multipole moments. This similar to the CO2-isa test,
  but the calculation is submitted to the batch queue using the
  submit_camcasp.py script. In this case the results have to be
  checked separately when the batch job is complete, following
  instructions given by the script.

H2O_dimer_scan
  Use the batch_camcasp.py script to submit a series of calculations
  to the batch queue for the H2O dimer at a number of different
  geometries. Again the results have to be checked separately when all
  the calculations are complete.


The calculations are carried out in sub-directories of the
CamCASP/tests directory. The check files are in the same
subdirectories.
