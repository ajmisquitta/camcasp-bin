There is an error in writer.cc from 
 psi4/src/psi4/libmints/
in Psi4 1.2 and pre-release 1.3. Unfortunately, for reasons I do not understand, 
the format of the FCHK file seems to depend on the system used: for some systems
the MO energies (Alpha or Beta) are not written.

The problem is discussed by 'susilehtola' at https://github.com/psi4/psi4/pull/1475
and he provides a replacement for writer.cc that is included here.

Presumably this code will be merged into the Psi4 master sometime soon, but for
the present it is included here.

To build Psi4 with this version of writer.cc:
=============================================
First of all, use caution. It is possible that your version of writer.cc has 
changes made that are not present in this one. So do a diff and merge the changes
carefully. Then rebuild Psi4 and re-install it.

Psi4 1.1 
  Format of the fchk file seems to be the one used by Gaussian.

Psi4 1.2 and 1.3
  Format has changed:
    Alpha and Beta energies are reported under 'orbital energies'
    and molecular orbital coefficients are under 'MO coefficients (C)'
  This is NOT the Gaussian format and should be corrected.
  It is possible that the Psi4 team has done this as they use the 
  fchk file only for the GDMA interface.

We should investigate a better and more robust interface to this code,
possibly using the Python wrappers to write out the energies and 
wavefunctions in a form we can use.

The interface now works with all versions of the code. 

The interface *should* run correctly if the basis space has been 
truncated.
