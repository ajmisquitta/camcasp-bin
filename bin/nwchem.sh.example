# Usage:
# nwchem.sh <datafile> [<cores>] 

# This script uses the environment-modules package to set the necessary
# environment variables and paths
# Load the mpi and nwchem modules if not already loaded
module is-loaded nwchem || module load mpi/openmpi/64/gnu nwchem
# or whatever may be needed to set up parallel processing

# If the second argument is present and greater than 1, run in parallel,
# using the specified number of cores.
# "${2:-0}" provides "0" if $2 is unset.
if (( ${2:-0} > 1 )); then
  mpirun -np $2 nwchem $1
else
# Otherwise just run serially 
  nwchem $1
fi

# If nwchem is not in the PATH it is necessary to replace "nwchem"
# above by the full path to the nwchem executable, or to set
# CamCASP/bin/nwchem as a symbolic link to it.
