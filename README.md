with many important modules and contributions from
Robert Bukowski, Wojciech Cencek and others.

CamCASP (Cambridge package for Calculation of Anisotropic Site
Properties) is a collection of scripts and programs written by
Alston Misquitta and Anthony Stone for the calculation ab initio of
distributed multipoles, polarizabilities, dispersion coefficients and
repulsion parameters for individual molecules, and interaction
energies between pairs of molecules using SAPT(DFT). The program is
still being actively developed. In addition to the programs included
in the package, CamCASP uses some other programs: Orient, and an ab
initio program, normally Dalton or NWChem or Psi4. 

* **Older Binary releases** can be obtained at the GitLab site maintained by Prof Anthony Stone at https://gitlab.com/anthonyjs/camcasp
* **The CamCASP Wiki** https://wiki.ph.qmul.ac.uk/ccmmp/AJMPublic/camcasp contains a large number of tutorials.
