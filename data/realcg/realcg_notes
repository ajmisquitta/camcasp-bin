These files contain coupling coefficients <j1k1,j2k2|JK> for coupling
two angular momenta or spherical tensors, expressed in real components
j1k1 and j2k2, into coupled components JK, also in real form. The file
realcg_j1_j2 contains the coupling coefficients for the angular
momenta j1 and j2. Only the nonzero coefficients are listed. Each line
of the file describes one nonzero coefficient in the form
l1 l2 L i1 i2 i3 i4
where l1, l2 and L are integers indexing the angular momentum
components. l1 and l2 index the components of j1 and j2 respectively:
0  1  2  3  4  5  6  ...
0  1c 1s 2c 2s 3c 3s ...
while L indexes the coupled function JK as follows:
0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9  ...
00  10  11c 11s 20  21c 21s 22c 22s 30 ...
The value of the coefficient is (i1/i2)sqrt(i3/i4). These
coefficients may be pure imaginary, in which case i3<0. sqrt(-n)
always means +i*sqrt(n). The transformation matrix between the
uncoupled functions |j1k1,j2k2> and the coupled functions |JK> is
unitary.
