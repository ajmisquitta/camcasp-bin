NOTE:

He, H2O, Formamide, Benzene:

We suggest running these examples in order of increasing size.

The results in these examples are *almost* what you would get with a 
default properties calculation as described in the User's Guide. 
The difference is that, to save time at the localization step, we have 
reduced the number of points in the grid used for point-to-point 
polarizabilities from the default of 2000 to 500. In the case of formamide
it takes an couple of minutes or so to calculate
the 22 million point-to-point polarizabilities that the 2000 point
grid (at 11 frequencies) would generate, so we use the smaller grid
for the tests. 

Since the Benzene job takes almost an hour to complete, there is little to
gain in reducing the number of point-to-point polarizabilities. Consequently
we have used the default of 2000 points (22 million point-to-point
polarizabilities) for this calculation.

The smaller grids have been obtained using the line 
OPTIONS TESTS
in the FILES block in the Cluster input files.



CO2-isa:

This is an example of a job using the new ISA module. See
CO2-isa/README for more details.
