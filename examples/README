See the README files in the subdirectories for descriptions of the
example calculations. Each example has its own directory. Change to
this directory and run the commands specified in the README file. A
new subdirectory will be created for the job. The example directories
include subdirectories called check or output_? that contain the
results of our calculations. The files generated by the script should
be the same, except possibly for rounding differences, dates and so
on. Running the jobs using the specified commands will not overwrite
these files.
