He2 energy scan
===============
Energy scans can be performed in two ways:
1) Using a monomer-centred (MC) auxiliary basis. I.e., auxiliary basis 
functions on the monomer only (no functions on the location of the 
partner).
2) Using a dimer-centred (DC) auxiliary basis in which functions are 
located on the monomer as well as the location of the (ghost) partner.

The latter is more accurate and is the recommended approach. 

Here we perform the energy scan of two helium atoms using both approaches.

(1) He2-MCaux-scan.cks
Basis: aTZ/MC
Aux: aTZ/MC
XC: PBE0/AC ALDAX+CHF
Reference output: ref-MCaux-scan/

(2) He2-DCaux-scan.cks
Basis: aTZ/MC
Aux: aTZ/DC
XC: PBE0/AC ALDAX+CHF
Reference output: ref-DCaux-scan/
Notes: 
  (1) Labels: The input file requires that you define the auxiliary basis sets
      in the DC format with *DIFFERENT* site labels. 
      Here we have used He1 and He2 as the site labels. If both had been
      called 'He' CamCASP will get confused and will stop. 
  (2) Coordinates: You don't need to worry about the coordinates of 
      the atoms in the auxiliary basis definition. CamCASP will automatically
      set the correct coordinates. What is assumed is that the ORDER of the
      atoms is the same as MON-A + MON-B and that the order is identical in 
      both auxiliary basis definitions. 
      So you cannot have auxiliary basis sets for He1 in the order He1, He2 and 
      auxiliary basis sets for He2 as He2,He1. Both should be in the same order:
      I.e., either both He1,He2 or both He2,He1. 

Running the jobs:
=================
$ runcamcasp He2-MCaux-scan -q <name of queue> --nochecks

To run the job in the background use '-q bg'. The '--nochecks' is needed
to suppress sanity checks from the runcamcasp script.
