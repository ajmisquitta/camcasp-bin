Benzene dimer 
=============
Basis: Sadlej-pVTZ MC+
Method: PBE/AC ALDAX

Time: 
  DALTON: 5 hours
  CamCASP: 70-90 mins

This is an example of a batch calculation using a set of configurations. In
this case, we have only one configuration in the geometry file, but you should
nevertheless get a good idea of how the calculation proceeds.

Files needed:
=============
(1) CLUSTER file: benzene2.clt
This is almost the usual cluster file. It contains two molecule blocks, one
for each benzene molecule in a reference geometry. Then come the following
lines:
   Rotate benzene2 by {alpha} about {Nx} {Ny} {Nz
   Place benzene2 at {Rx} {Ry} {Rz}
The values of alpha, Nx, Ny, Nz, Rx, Ry, Rz will be set by the batch_SAPT.pl
script. These lines must contain these variable names in the given form. 
CASE MATTERS here.

It is important to be consistent with UNITS. The UNITS specified in the
CLUSTER file need to be consistent with the geometry units in the geometry
file (below). In this example, we have used BOHR and DEGREES in the geometry
file, so we need:
GLOBAL
  UNITS BOHR DEGREES
END
in the preamble.

NOTE: We always keep molecule 1 fixed and translate/rotate molecule 2.

Following that comes the FILES (or RUN-TYPE) block. There is one important
line:
   File-prefix {job}
This must be present in exactly this form. {jpb} will be replaced by a job name.
The rest of the specifications here are pretty much as usual.

(2) Geometry file: random-grid_points.dat
It contains a few comment lines (starting with '! ') and then the geometry
specification in BOHR and DEGREES (other units are possible, in which case the
UNITS command in the CLUSTER file should be changed).
The order of the entries must be:
   INDEX  Rx     Ry     Rz    alpha    Nx      Ny     Nz
INDEX: Index of the geometry. 
Rx,Ry,Rz: (BOHR) Translation vector of centre of molecule 2.
Nx,Ny,Nz: (dimensionless) Components of vector that defines rotation
          axis. This need not be a unit vector.
angle   : (DEGREES) Angle by which molecule 2 is rotated about the vector
          (Nx,Ny,Nz).

We normally generate the geometries using the ENERGY-SCAN module in
CamCASP. This can create a random selection of geometries near van der
Waals contact.

Command:
========
The job is run using
$ batch_SAPT.pl benzene2 -geom random-grid_points.dat -clt benzene2.clt 
  --dalton-direct -q <specify the queue>
Here we have specified:
job name      : benzene2
geometry file : random-grid_points.dat
Cluster file  : benzene2.clt
DALTON options: --dalton-direct creates DALTON command files with the
                .DIRECT directive. This avoids excessive disk access
                and is recommended for large jobs.
queue         : As usual, the appropriate queue needs to be specified.

The batch_sapt.py script will use the job name ("benzene2") and the
INDEX in the geometry file to create a unique name for each dimer
configuration. A directory with this name will be created for the
output files for this configuration. In this case there will be only
one directory: 
    benzene2_1/

The output will be in benzene2_1/OUT. There is a search script that will
search through all directories for you. 

Searching:
==========
$ batch_search.pl benzene2 -geom random-grid_points.dat

You need to tell it the job name ("benzene2") and the name of the geometry
file. By default it will search for SAPT(DFT) energies. This can be changed by
placing one of the recognised search keys in a file titled 'keys' (or another
file, in which case specify the file using -keys <keys file> on the command
line).

The output will be:
$ batch_search.pl benzene2 -geom random-grid_points.dat 
    INDEX         Rx         Ry         Rz      alpha         Nx         Ny         Nz       elst       exch     ind2UC   exind2UC    disp2UC  exdisp2UC     disp2C      ind2C     ind3UC   exind3UC    exind2C   exdisp2C    Eint(2)   Eint(3*)  
        0          1          2          3          4          5          6          7          8          9         10         11         12         13         14         15         16         17         18         19         20         21  
        1   0.000000   0.000000   7.180962 180.000000   1.000000   0.000000   0.000000  -0.754377  15.352100  -5.808190   4.971163 -49.855776   4.243172 -22.820805  -5.428468    -----      -----     4.646164   1.942254  -7.063133    -----  

The search script assumes:
(1) Energy units in the CamCASP output: cm-1
(2) Output energy units               : kJ/mol

If a calculation has failed or if certain energies have not been calculated 
the output will contain '-----' strings.

A more useful key to search for is 'saptdft-camcasp' as this prints out energy
components in a format suitable for further processing by CamCASP.

$ cat keys 
saptdft-camcasp
$ batch_search.pl benzene2 -geom random-grid_points.dat 
    INDEX         Rx         Ry         Rz      alpha         Nx         Ny         Nz       elst      ind2C     disp2C       exch    exind2C   exdisp2C

Caveats:
========
There is ample opportunity to make mistakes in such a calculation. SO before
submitting a job to the queue, use the '-q none' option to generate the input
files, inspect them, and only then use the proper queue name to submit the
jobs.
