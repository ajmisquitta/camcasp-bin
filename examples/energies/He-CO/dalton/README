Reference energies from a very large basis calculation:

 \delta_HF = -1.4282 cm-1

  B97-2/AC + \delta_HF   -22.9083  cm-1 
  PBE0/AC + \delta_HF    -22.7398  cm-1

We have a problem with our He induction energies. This seems reminicent of 
the Argon problems and that one was associated with DALTON. One symptom is 
unusually large off-diagonal DF violations. We see the same here too. Though 
less than with Argon.
