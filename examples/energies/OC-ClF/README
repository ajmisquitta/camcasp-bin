OC-ClF
======

This is an example of a system involving two different molecules, and
also an example of halogen bonding. The procedure is as for the H2O2
example; see the README for that if necessary. The commands needed are

$ runcamcasp.py OC-ClF --clt OC-ClF.clt -d test --direct -q batch
$ runcamcasp.py OC-ClF --clt OC-ClF_dHF.clt -d test_dHF --direct -q batch

(Change the -q argument to specify a different queue is necessary.)
These calculations take about 10 mins cpu in all. When they have
finished:

The `check' directories contain calculations using Dalton-2013, while
the `check_nwchem' calculations used NWChem. The results are slightly
different because of the different treatment of asymptotic correction.
The method used by CamCASP if Dalton is used can be specified in the
cluster file as
  AC multpole tanh 3.0 4.0
and is generally found to give good results. Unfortunately this method
is not available with NWChem, but the results are not usually very
different.
