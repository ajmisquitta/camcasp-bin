Water dimer
===========
Minimum energy dimer geometry from 
Mas and Szalewicz, J. Chem. Phys. 104 (1996)

Basis: Sadlej pVTZ/MC+

The cluster file is water2.clt, so the command to run the calculation is

$ runcamcasp.py H2O2 --clt water2.clt -d test -M 500

"-M 500" specifies the memory for the job in MB. The default is 2000 MB.
You may need to append "-q <queue>" where <queue> is the name of the
batch queue that you wish to use, or "bg" to run the job in the
background. The default is to run the job in the background. If you
expect to use the same queue most or all of the time, set the
environment variable QUEUE to this value -- e.g.
export QUEUE=bg
and then that will be taken as the default.

The directory ./check/ contains copies of the files that
should be generated for the job.


Some minutes later ...

$ ls test
H2O2_A.dal  H2O2.bash   H2O2_B.out   H2O2.template  vectB.data
H2O2_A.mol  H2O2_B.dal  H2O2.cks     OUT            water2.clt
H2O2_A.out  H2O2_B.mol  H2O2_P.data  vectA.data     water2.clt.clout

$ ls test/OUT
H2O2_A.out  H2O2_B.out  H2O2.cks  H2O2.out  TMP_Memory_usage.dat

H2O2_A.out and H2O2_B.out are the Dalton output files for the two
monomer calculations. H2O2.out contains the output from the
SAPT(DFT) calculation. To pick out the interaction energy terms from
the output file, we use extract_saptdft.py (run "extract_saptdft.py
--help" for details of the usage):

$ extract_saptdft.py test
kJ/mol       elst        exch         ind        exind       disp      exdisp      total
test         -28.88477    23.80508   -10.52601     5.92262    -9.70338     1.64653   -17.73994

Eint = -17.74 kJ/mol

This calculation omits the higher-order induction terms, which are
important for hydrogen-bonded systems such as this. We estimate their
effect by carrying out a Hartree-Fock supermolecule calculation and
subtracting off the Hartree-Fock equivalents of the terms that we have
obtained by SAPT(DFT). What is left is a reasonable estimate of the
higher-order induction terms. The data file for this procedure is
deltahf.clt, which is very similar to the water2.clt data file, but
includes the deltaHF keyword. We put the files into a different
directory test_dHF:

$ runcamcasp.py H2O2 --clt deltahf.clt -d test_dHF -M 500

When this calculation has finished, the results are in the
test_dHF/OUT directory:

$ ls test_dHF/OUT
H2O2_AB.out    H2O2_A.out    H2O2_B.out    H2O2.cks                H2O2.out
H2O2_AB.out.0  H2O2_A.out.0  H2O2_B.out.0  H2O2-data-summary.data  TMP_Memory_usage.dat

Use extract_saptdft.py to extract
the energy components from both directories. The script assumes that
the test_dHF directory belongs with the sapt-dft calculation in the
test directory, and presents the results togther:

$ extract_saptdft.py test test_dHF
kJ/mol       elst        exch         ind        exind       disp       exdisp        dHF        total
test         -28.88477    23.80508   -10.52601     5.92262    -9.70338     1.64653    -2.70162   -20.44156

The total energy including the delta-HF correction is then -20.44 kJ/mol,
in good (though somewhat fortuitous) agreement with the CCSD(T) value,
for the same basis set, of -20.45 kJ/mol (Misquitta 2010)

The check* and check_nwchem* directories contain previous results
using Dalton and NWChem respectively. To see all the results, use
$ extract_saptdft.py *
kJ/mol           elst        exch         ind        exind       disp       exdisp        dHF        total
check        -28.88477    23.80508   -10.52601     5.92262    -9.70338     1.64653    -2.70162   -20.44156
check_nwchem 
             -28.71150    24.87201   -10.84332     6.25785    -9.91698     1.71489    -2.70204   -19.32908
test         -28.88477    23.80508   -10.52601     5.92262    -9.70338     1.64653    -2.70162   -20.44156

The script looks only at directories, ignoring plain files. The
results from NWChem are somewhat different from those from Dalton,
because it treats the asymptotic correction differently.
