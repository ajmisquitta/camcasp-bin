Title  Template Cluster file for isa-pol-from-isa-A-restart

! Notes
! -----
! An ISA A calculation uses the ISA A functional only.
! This implies that different basis sets can be used for the
! density-fitting (the AUX basis) and the atomic basis sets
! that are used for the ISA expansions (the ATOMAUX basis).
! HOWEVER, convergence seems more reliable if these are kept
! the same. 
!
! Here we have assumed you have performed an ISA calculation
! (any type) and have a *.ISA file present.
! This job will restart the ISA-A algorithm using the ISA
! shape-function expansions present in that file. 
!
! Restarts are useful when you need molecular properties
! calculated to a higher accuracy. In this example we achieve this
! using a potentially more accurate density-fitting with the 
! Cartesian form of the AUX basis. 
!
! Check the validity of the ISA-A solution before trusing the
! ISA-Pol results!

Show MOL in XYZ format         ( always a useful check )

Run-Type
  CamCASP-Only                 ( as this is a restart, you will already have the      )
                               ( *.movecs file. So all you need is a new CamCASP file )
  Molecule     MOL

  ! In this example the AUX basis is aVTZ (RI basis) and ATOMAUX is aVQZ(RI)+ISAset
  ! Here the AUX is the standard AUX basis with Cartesian GTOs.
  ! The ATOMAUX basis should have the same s-functions as were
  ! used in the original ISA-A calculation. The higher angular functions can 
  ! be different.

  Main-Basis     aVTZ   Type  MC
  Aux-Basis      aVTZ   Type  MC   Spherical    No-ISA-Basis  ( this is the standard density-fitting basis )
  AtomAux-Basis  aVQZ   Type  MC   Spherical   Use-ISA-Basis
  ISA-AtomAux-Basis  set2   Min-S-exp-H = 0.2   
                               ( Convergence tends to be better with this setting )
                               ( Use ISA-AtomAux-Basis rather than ISA-Basis so   )
                               ( that the ISA basis is used only for AtomAux.     )

  Func         PBE0            ( other functionals possible, but this is probably the best )
  AC           MULTIPOLE       ( [TH | LINEAR | GRAC] [CS00 | MULTIPOLE | LB94] : CS00 with NWChem)
  Kernel       ALDA+CHF        ( needed for the Pol calculation )
  SCF-code     <name of code>  ( DALTON2015, NWCHEM, etc )

  MO-FILE      <MOL.movecs>  Format ASCII  ( Set this to the acutal MO file )

  File-Prefix  MOL-ISA-Pol-ISA-A-restart   ( change this to something reasonable )

  #METHOD      isa-pol-from-isa-A-restart  ( this will use the file isa-pol-from-isa-A-restart from the methods/ directory )
