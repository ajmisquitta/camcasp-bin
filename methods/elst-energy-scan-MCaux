! MOL..Q or MOL..MOL or MOL..Q & MOL energy scans with the MC auxiliary basis

! The Monomer-Centered (MC) auxiliary basis results in fast calculations.
! While this option is appropriate for the density-overlap integral calculation, and
! perhaps even calculations of E(1)exch, it is not recommended that E(1)elst be calculated
! using the MC auxiliary basis as the errors introduced by the density-fitting 
! can be large, particularly in non-polar systems for which the density-tails 
! play an important role the first-order energies. 

! For a charge probe calculation we recomment you use a charge of -1.0e if induction 
! energies are being computed. This reduces the chance of spurious charge movements that
! could occur if a positive charge probe was used.

! Only needed for large molecules

BEGIN energy-scan
  !  Scan electrostatic potential on the specified grid
  Scan molecule A with charge -1.0
  ! For a scan with the partner molecule use:
  !    Scan molecule A with B
  ! For both scans combined:

  Points
    !  Provide points file (created by Orient or CamCASP)
    !  Give full path or put the file in the job directory
    !  e.g.
    !  file /home/ajs1/molecules/piracetam/aug-cc-pVDZ_-63/piracetam_vdW1.50.pts
    !  or make a symbolic link grid.pts to the appropriate file
    !  If Traslations-Only is specified (as is done here) the format of points should be:
    !  X1  Y1  Z1
    !  X2  Y2  Z2
    !  ...

    !  If an initial index column is included as in:
    !  1  X1  Y1  Z1
    !  2  X2  Y2  Z2
    !  .. ...
    !  Then also include the command:
    !   SKIP-FIRST-COLUMN
    !  If the points are of the form (translation+angle-axis):
    !  X1  Y1  Z1  ALPHA1  NX1  NY1  NZ1
    !  X2  Y2  Z2  ALPHA2  NX2  NY2  NZ2
