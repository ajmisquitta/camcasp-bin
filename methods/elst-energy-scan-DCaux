! MOL..MOL energy scan with DC auxiliary basis

! The Dimer-Centered (DC) auxiliary basis consists of auxiliary basis functions
! on both molecules. To correctly update the geometry of this basis CamCASP needs
! explicit commands that cause each molecule to define a partner: A -> B and B -> A.
! So when A is translated/rotated, B knows and is appropriately updated, and 
! vice versa. 

! NOTE: At present, the code also needs the auxiliary basis sets of A and B to contain 
! sites in the same order. So both basis sets will contain functions for A and B, in 
! that order.
