Title  Template Cluster file for isa-A-dma (ISA and DMA moments)

! Notes
! -----
! An ISA A+DF calculation uses the ISA A functional only.
! This implies that different basis sets can be used for the
! density-fitting (the AUX basis) and the atomic basis sets
! that are used for the ISA expansions (the ATOMAUX basis).
! HOWEVER, convergence seems more reliable if these are kept
! the same. 
!
! The AUX basis can use Cartesian GTOs, but we have found
! issues with convergence in some cases that have done so.
! If you need to use Cartesian GTOs in AUX, first converge the ISA-A
! with spherical GTOs in AUX and then restart using 
! Cartesian GTOs in AUX (see method isa-A-restart)

  Main-Basis     aVTZ   Type  MC
  Aux-Basis      aVTZ   Type  MC   Spherical   Use-ISA-Basis  ( this basis could be Cartesian )
  AtomAux-Basis  aVQZ   Type  MC   Spherical   Use-ISA-Basis
  ISA-Basis      set2   Min-S-exp-H = 0.2   
                               ( convergence tends to be better with this setting )

  Func         PBE0            ( other functionals possible, but this is probably the best )
  AC           MULTIPOLE       ( [TH | LINEAR | GRAC] [CS00 | MULTIPOLE | LB94] : CS00 with NWChem)
  Kernel       ALDA+CHF        ( not needed for an ISA calculation )
  SCF-code     <name of code>  ( DALTON2015, NWCHEM, etc )

  File-Prefix  MOL-ISA-A-DMA   ( change this to something reasonable )

  #METHOD      isa-A-dma       ( this will use the file isa-A-dma from the methods/ directory )
