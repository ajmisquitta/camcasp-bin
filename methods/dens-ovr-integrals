! This is where the distributed density-overlap parameters are set.
! We use the ISA-based partitioning on a density obtained using DF without
! constraints. The ISA-based partitioning algorithm can be done
! in basis-space (not a good idea) or in real-space. The latter is
! much more accurate, but takes longer.
! We set the grid parameters for the integration. These parameters
! are known to work well.
!
! About the options:
! Type    : which algorithm. ISA or DF. ISA is used here and it
!           uses the ISA definition of the atoms-in-a-molecule.
!           DF uses density-fitting and is less reliable.
! DF-type : Used to define the density used in the partitioning. 
!           Options are OO and RHO with or without constraints.
!           In practice it is the constraints that matter most.
!           The charge conservation constraint (LAMBDA) is a good 
!           idea.
! ISA-DIST-TYPE : Sets the kind of distribution scheme used with the
!           ISA type of distribution. Options are BASIS and GRID.
! DF-INTEGRAL-SWITCH : Sets the type of integral used for the 
!           one-electron overlap integral. 1: no density fitting,
!           0: density fitting. This has an effect only for TYPE DF.
! Integration-Grid : Set the integration grid parameters used for the 
!           ISA GRID option. A fine grid would use 60 radial and 400 angular
!           points per atom, but this can be excessive.
! ISA-Options : Set various options for the ISA partitioning. 
!           TAIL-FIX can be used to 'fix' the ISA tails. This may or
!           may not be a good idea. It seems to depend on how the tail
!           fix is defined (obviously).
! Print-Results : Print out the distribution results. Useful only when 
!           testing the module as there can be a lot of information
!           printed out.
